# git-flow AVH Edition development git hooks

This is a collection of git hooks to be used in conjunction with git-flow AVH
edition.

It also has some standard git hooks that were originally created by [Sitebase](https://github.com/Sitebase/git-hooks).
I just adjusted their code to make it work for me.

These hooks are used by me for development of git-flow AVH Edition itself

## Installation

* Clone the repository
* Create a softlink in your repository .git directory named hooks. If the
  directory exists, just delete it.
* Copy the file hooks_config.sample to the .git directory, naming it hooks_config.
* Make the needed adjustments to the hooks_config file.

## Requirements

* git-flow AVH edition
* Bash shell script.
* Use the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) specification.

## Information

* When you start a release you can omit the version number. The filter will grep
  the version set in the stable info of the master branch and increase the patch level.
* You can't commit on a master branch.
* You can't commit files with merge markers.
* Commit messages shorter than 8 are not allowed.

## hooks_config file

There should be no need to make adjustments to the hooks_config file
